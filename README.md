OpenCore EFI configs

This is a repository of OpenCore EFI configs for machines I come across.
These folders represent my relentess attemps at running macOS (Mac OS X)
They may not come of much use, but use and tweak to your hearts content, updates may be rare but when I come across what I think is a success, I will upload for others to try on their own machines that match the device is was made for.
Have fun and good luck.
